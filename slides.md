# Redux
---

> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

---

# The State

Imagine your appâ€™s state is described as a plain object.

```js
{
  todos: [{
    text: 'Eat food',
    completed: true
  }, {
    text: 'Exercise',
    completed: false
  }]
}
```

---

# Actions

To change something in the state, you need to dispatch an action. An action is a plain JavaScript object.

```js
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Go to swimming pool' }
{ type: 'TOGGLE_TODO', id: 1 }
```

---

# Action Creators

*Pure functions* that return an action.

```js
const addTodo(description: string) => ({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  text: todo.text
})
```

Usage:

```js
addTodo('Take the hobbits to Isengard')
```

---
# Pure functions

A pure function is a function where the return value is only determined by its input values.

```js
f(x) => Math.rand() ðŸ˜ 

f(x) => x * 2 ðŸ˜Š
```

---

# The Reducer

A function that takes state and action as arguments, and returns the next state of the app

```JavaScript
f(state, action) => state
```

---

# IRL Example

The Reducer of Life:

```js
f(h: Hunger, action: Action) => Hunger
```

Let's use it.

```js
({hungry: true}, dinner) => return {hungry: false}

({hungry: false}, sleep) => return {hungry: true}
```

---

# The Reducer

```js
const reducer = (state: Todo[] = [], action: Action): Todo[] => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [...state, { text: action.text, completed: false }]
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      return state.map(
        (todo, index) =>
          action.index === index
            ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed }
            : todo
      )
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

---

# 3 Principles

---

# Single Source of Truth:

The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

---

# State is read-only

The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.

---

#Changes are made with pure functions

To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.

---

# Usage with React

React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update data.

```js
npm install --save react-redux
```

---

# The Store

The Store is the object that brings them together. The store has the following responsibilities:

- Holds application state;
- Allows access to state via getState();
- Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);
- A little bit more.

---

# The Store at a Glance

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import reducer from './reducers'
const store = createStore(reducer)
```

---

# Provider

React Redux provides `<Provider />`, which makes the Redux store available to the rest of your app:

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  rootElement
)
```

---

# Connecting the Dots

React Redux provides a connect function for you to connect your component to the store.

```js
connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)
```

---

# mapState To Props

This will populate properties of your component with values from the state.

```js
state => ({
  prop: state.prop,
  otherProp: state.otherProp
})
```
---

# mapDispatchToProps

 This function will populate your properties with1 action creators that will dispatch those actions to the store to modify the state.

```js
dispatch => ({
  anAction: params => dispatch(anAction(params))
})
```

---

# Middlewares

Is something you can put between the framework receiving a request, and the framework generating a response.

# Example of a middleware

```js
// logger.js
const logger = store => next => action => {
  console.log('dispatching', action)
  let result = next(action)
  console.log('next state', store.getState())
  return result
}

// index.js
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'

const store = createStore(
  reducer,
  applyMiddleware(logger)
)
```

# Thunk Actions

Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function to perform asynchronous dispatch.

A _thunk_ is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation.

The term originated as a humorous past-tense version of "think".

---

# Installation

`npm install redux-thunk`
Then, to enable Redux Thunk, use applyMiddleware():

```js
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
// ...
const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  applyMiddleware(thunk)
);
```

---

# Now what?

```js
const getMovies() => {
  return dispatch => apiCall().then(result => {
    return dispatch(addMovie(result));
  })
}
```

---

# Let's Thunk this Through

We'll pre-populate our list of movies.
